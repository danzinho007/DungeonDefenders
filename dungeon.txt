"Etheria" was once a land of "living legends"
Long ago, "brave warriors" across the realm stood together against an immortal evil know as the "Old Ones"
In the wake of this struggle, the "champions" locked away the power of the "Old Ones" inside "Eternia Crystal"
Recently, the realm's "Heroes", called to a far away crusade, have left their "younger kin" to tend the castle and its chores
